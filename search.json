There are some key nuances with this approach:\n\nProducts sold in both periods are included in both periods, thus new products are omitted.\nWe fix the relative importance of the goods for both periods based on period 1 weight, thus we do not reflect changes in composition over time (substitution). This can be convenient as we need weights only for the base period.\n\nMost price indices are variants of the Laspeyres, such as the Lowe (which compare the prices from the current month with the previous month, but use weights from a year before that)",
