    "text": "Laspeyres index\nThe simplest formula (and one that is commonly used) is the Laspeyres index:\n\\(I^{L}_{0,1} = \\frac{\\sum_{m=1}^{M}(P_{m,1}Q_{m,0})}{\\sum_{m=1}^{M}(P_{m,0}Q_{m,0}})\\)\nWhere P’s and Q’s denote prices and quantities, and 0 and 1 denote two points in time.\nIf M goods are sold in both periods (note that an overlap is needed), we can compare the the cost of purchasing the same goods we bought in period 1 with a certain period in the future.\nWe can also write the Laspeyres as the weighted arithmetic average of the price change of the individual products in the index\n\\(I^L_{0,1} = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} (w_{m,0}\\frac{P_{m,1}}{P_{m,0}})\\)\nwhere the \\(w_{m,0} = (P_{m,0}Q_{m,0})/\\sum_{m=1}^{M}(P_{m,0}Q_{m,0})\\) give the ratio of good m’s expenditure to total expenditure, or could also be considered the relative importance or share of the product. There are some key nuances with this approach:\n\nProducts sold in both periods are included in both periods, thus new products are omitted.\nWe fix the relative importance of the goods for both periods based on period 1 weight, thus we do not reflect changes in composition over time (substitution). This can be convenient as we need weights only for the base period.\n\nMost price indices are variants of the Laspeyres, such as the Lowe (which compare the prices from the current month with the previous month, but use weights from a year before that)\n\n\nSee empirical examples:",
