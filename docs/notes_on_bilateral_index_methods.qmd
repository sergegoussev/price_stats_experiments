# Overview

This page provides an overview of Bilateral Price Index methods. Several sources are used (included in the links to the page) to go over key concepts. Emprical examples are linked from this page or can be found in the main guide

## The concept of price index methods

> A price index provides an aggregate measure of price change for a particular product segment, industry, or overall economy. ... \[They compare\] the cost of purchasing a set of goods at different points in time. This "set of goods" is often referred to as the "market basket" or the "bundle" of goods. - Aizcorbe (2014)

# Main formulas

## Laspeyres index

The simplest formula (and one that is commonly used) is the Laspeyres index:

$I^{L}_{0,1} = \frac{\sum_{m=1}^{M}(P_{m,1}Q_{m,0})}{\sum_{m=1}^{M}(P_{m,0}Q_{m,0}})$

Where P's and Q's denote prices and quantities, and 0 and 1 denote two points in time.

If M goods are sold in both periods (note that an overlap is needed), we can compare the the cost of purchasing the same goods we bought in period 1 with a certain period in the future.

We can also write the Laspeyres as the weighted arithmetic average of the price change of the individual products in the index

$I^L_{0,1} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} (w_{m,0}\frac{P_{m,1}}{P_{m,0}})$

where the $w_{m,0} = (P_{m,0}Q_{m,0})/\sum_{m=1}^{M}(P_{m,0}Q_{m,0})$ give the ratio of good m's expenditure to total expenditure, or could also be considered the relative importance or share of the product. There are some key nuances with this approach:

-   Products sold in both periods are included in both periods, thus new products are omitted.
-   We fix the relative importance of the goods for both periods based on period 1 weight, thus we do not reflect changes in composition over time (substitution). This can be convenient as we need weights only for the base period.
    -   Most price indices are variants of the Laspeyres, such as the Lowe (which compare the prices from the current month with the previous month, but use weights from a year before that)
