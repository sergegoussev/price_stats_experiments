# Overview

Even when scanner data is available, not all data necessarily needs to be used to calculate elementary price indices. There are two sampling approaches that are typically used as they are quite effective ways to use a subset of the data but - the static and dynamic sample methods. A requirement for sampling is that each unique product is already classified to categories within which the elementary price indices are calculated.

# Fixed sample method

## The concept

The fixed sample method simulates a traditional approach, similar to field collection. The sample is refreshed every year to stay representative and replacement is used to maintain the sample following a traditional methodology (except that as scanner data is available to evaluation, i.e. seeing all products and all transactions provides a lot of additional detail of what product to replace with).

The method is simple (in the sense that it follows a traditional methodology and can be combined with other data in a traditional way), however it is resource intensive as replacement must be dealt with manually (for example [the Netherlands found it too costly to extend to 6 scanner retailers and shifted to the dynamic sample method](https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.22/2010/zip.6.e.pdf)). It is also typically used with only a small (although representative) sample of data.

A consequence of the method is that only similar products are selected for most disappearing items (to avoid quality adjustment), which means the method is most applicable to situations where quality change is not a major factor in the category. The method is also only applicable to categories with little churn as representativity of the products in sample will decline quickly if this is not the case. Both of these consequences are only partially mitigated by the annual product resampling.

## Step-by-step process

The summary of the overall process is best summarized by the [Eurostat (2017) guide, chapter 6](https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/7b031f10-ac19-4da3-a36f-58708a70133d/library/8e1333df-ca16-40fc-bc6a-1ce1be37247c/details):

> In the static approach, a sample is drawn from year t and used for 12 months following December of year t. The sample is kept and replacements are made as needed.

In a more detailed sense, the following steps are used to select and maintain the sample:

-   Step 1: For each category (typically COICOP 6) for which an elementary price index will be calculated, select a number of items (representative products) at the beginning of the year which were representative the previous year. For instance you can look at products that constituted the top 50% of annual turnover.

    -   Select unique products (such as by European Article Number (EAN)) per supermarket chain and stores (to ensure that coverage by all chains in the sample is maintained)
    -   With this approach, we may end up with a lot of observations per category, or too few, in which case a little tuning is necessary.
    -   Each item given a weight representing its relative importance

-   Step 2: A monthly price index (i.e. relative) for each item is calculated as the unit value in the current month and unit value in the base year.

-   Step 3: An elementary price index as the weighted average of each item’s relatives using the Laspeyres (as is done on at the higher level aggregation).

    -   Chain the indices at December to create a long-term series
    -   Ongoing work to replace:
        -   If there is a big shift (but no exit), a product could be replaced manually using the bridged overlap method. Explicit quality adjustment used only when needed in a select number of cases. Implicit methods (typically the bridged overlap method) are used.
            -   TO DO: Flush out process of bridged overlap method and explicit quality adjustment used in this case
    -   If an item disappeared – replace it with a similar one that was present in the base period.

# Dynamic sample method

## The concept

-   Procedure to do fixed sample method is too labor intensive to extend to many retailers (6 in the Netherlands case) from the a few when the fixed sample method was sufficient. This procedure requires much less manual work.

-   The dynamic method was also found to closely approximate the GEKS

-   An unweighted Jevons is used to avoid chain drift

-   Not used by Netherlands everywhere, only some traditional categories.

## Step-by-step process

-   Step 1: use a cut off method to select a products with most of the sales – as in general a relatively small proportion of products will be responsible for the majority of expenditures and carry the most weight in weighted indices. The threshold chosen in the Dutch case was that 50% of the items are selected to represent 80-85% of expenditures

$\frac{s_{t}+s_{t+1}}{2}>\frac{1}{n\times\lambda}$

Where

$\frac{(s_t+s\_(t+1))}{2}$ – the product’s average share between the two periods

$n$ – the number of products

$\lambda$ – 1.25

-   Step 2: Calculate movement for category based on the unit value price in this month over unit value price the previous month.

    -   Pre-processing is needed at this stage to get unit prices
    -   Also filtering/cleaning applied:
        -   Outlier filter excludes anything 300% higher and 75% decline
        -   Dumping filter is used to exclude strong simultaneous price and quantity decreases – as this dumping in prices without an offsetting price increase will have a downward effect on the index.
    -   EAN used for matched model method, but cleaning/investigation needed to make sure EAN is stable (sometimes retailers recycle EANs). SKU can be used where applicable as it may be more stable (sometimes capture the relaunch problem)
    -   Only the first several weeks of data are used – the Dutch case its 3 weeks, consistent with field collection

-   Step 3: If item is missing – impute its price once (as you may have temporarily missing) by multiplying the last observed price by the Jevons of the category movement

-   Step 4: If explicit adjustments needed such as package changes – can be made manually

    -   Examples are change in package sizes that are really the same for the consumer (i.e. EANs are basically too detailed, and we need a way to link/group 2 products together).
    -   Other implicit quality adjustment stays as per the matched model approach
    -   TO DO: flush out example

-   Step 6: Integrate retailer specific COICOP6 indices together using Laspeyres method – i.e. higher-level aggregation unchanged
