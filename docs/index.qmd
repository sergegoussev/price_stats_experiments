## Purpose of site

This is a personal site that I used to render experiments and workflows that relate to the price statistics domain within official statistics. It is meant to log various experiments and notes to myself in a reproducible manner. Anyone else can use this if they choose but it is not explicitly meant for any formal capacity.
